After cloning the repo, make the following two changes (both needed for distributed training):

- create a folder in the repo with the name ‘logs’

- in the settings file, ‘hparams.py’ change the ‘dist_url’ to a unique number
 
Use the tacotr:ver1 docker which has the prerequisites installed, start it interactively with specific GPUs assigned to the docker with for example the following command:

docker run --gpus '"device=6,7"' --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 -it --rm --ipc=host -v $PWD:/workspace/tacotron2 tacotr:ver1 /bin/sh -c 'cd /workspace/tacotron2; bash'
