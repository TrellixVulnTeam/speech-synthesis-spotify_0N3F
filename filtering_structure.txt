Filtering Audio


-- Input
	
	Options:
		1. Several .wav files (path)
		2. Timestamps in which the audio should be segmented

-- Segment file:
Segment object for each segment

	Input: Path + timesteps
	
	Attributes: 
		- Path
		- (Beginning, end)
		- Wave

	Methods: 
		- Pitch: list
		- Avg Pitch: float
		- Energy: float
		- Intensity: list
		- Avg Intensity: float
		- SpeechRate: float

		(?) Has Noise: bool
		(?) Amount of noise:
		(?) Has Music: bool
		(?) Amount of music:


-- Filtering file:
Define constant "valid" intervals for each feature
Ex: 80% for Avg Pith, 50% for Energy


Compute the avg value of each feature for:
- Episode

	If Sound.feature out of the interval [Avg feature - %, Avg feature + %]:
		Discard
	Else
		Keep the segment:
			Store a list of tuples (init timestamp, final timestamp)

-- Output 

	List of Segments representing valid segments
